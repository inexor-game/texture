[Instructions for Q3Radiant/GTKRadiant users]

Basic usage: (not recommended)
Extract the .zip file into your "baseq3" folder.

Add "ecel" (no quotes) to your shaderlist.txt in your \scripts folder to see them in Q3Radient/GTKRadient

Suggested usage:
I'd encourage you to make your own directories for my textures for your map like so ... 

"baseq3/textures/mymapname/" (place my textures here.)

"baseq3/scripts/mymapname.shader" (add my shaders here, making sure to edit the paths in the original shader file.)



[Thanks]
Everyone who had kind words to say about my other sets and
the people at the mapcenter forum and Quake3World.com Level Editing Forum.

Everyone who has used/will use my textures in their maps.
This is why I make them. :)



[Stuff]
If you use any of the textures it would be cool if you emailed me with the url to some screenshots if possible. 
I really would like to see what uses mappers have made of them.
